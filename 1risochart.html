           This film is an exploration of metric montage which contrasts a series of overwhelming
cuts with a grounded, slow ending. To show stress even more, the
character has a few frames that are hand drawn and stop motion to disassociate the viewer
and truly detach him from the environment he was once in. In a way, bringing the viewer into a storyboard.
