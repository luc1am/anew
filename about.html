   <h2>Hey I'm Lucia</h2>
    <p>  I am a Filipino-American creator, and I grew up in Hawai’i on the island of O’ahu. My current art practice is fabrication. It combines everything I am interested in, the art of process, iterating on ideas and prototypes, working with new material, but mostly I loved that I was able to make something I could really hold. Being exposed to more machines such as the CNC router, 3D printing, laser cutting, and the Risograph, creates a flow of ideas that feels right.</p>
    
    <p>  Fabrication, in its strength, combines a wide range of technology and skills in different mediums. In as many ways as possible, I am interested in building and fabricating in all my favorite mediums and more.</p>
