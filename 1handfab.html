        <p>This is a cardboard hand as a practice to push myself in my new sculpture class.
            The concept was any cardboard structure that can hold your body. 
            This one I modeled in Maya (though I would've preferred other programs) and sliced with
            Slicer for Fusion 360.

            As some of the pieces were larger than what could fit on our 
            Laser Cutters at Tandon's Makerspace, I decided to handcut each one on the bandsaw. 

            This was both faster than using a box cutter, and gave a nice consistent edge on 
            each cut.
        </p>
        <p>I am pretty happy with this project and I can safely sit on it like a comfortable little stool.</p>
