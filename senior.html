      <h2>Project Outline</h2>
      <p> 	This project is situated on the intersection of craft and technology. The art of “craft” is a dying medium. Knitting, weaving, sewing, quilting, all things considered to be a womanly task not worthy of the title “art.” Technology, on the other hand, can almost justify itself in any space. I don’t find so much validity in the buzzwords of technology, but I love the art that is created out of hacking an artform. In mixing coding with knitting, I hope to create a new medium that subverts each from their own prejudices. Coding can become something very handmade, changing with each pass of a carriage under hand, and knitting can be less representational and more indicative of a desire to be post-human. 
         </p>
         <p> 	I got my knitting machine off Craigslist from a lovely lady who drove down to Chinatown from upstate to let me buy her knitting machine. On the walk to my apartment which she and her husband accompanied me on, she introduced me to the concept of All Yarns Are Beautiful (AYAB), a German knitting project that connects to the computer so you can more easily upload custom designs to the computerized knitting machine. This is an existing technology that the AYAB team has worked on, and it is open source on GitHub for messing with it and playing with the technologies. From there, it was a dream to work with AYAB for my own knitting purposes. </p>
         <p> With this project, I will create large scale knitted planes that are decorated with color and variation of pixels, patterns, and texture, all while using just yarn, a knitting machine, and a little bit of code. </p>

      <h2>UPDATE: they stole my package</h2>
      <img src="assets/stolenpackage.jpg" alt="">
      <p>Everything I need to make my arduino shield was supposed to arrive on Wednesday. The package got delayed to 
        Friday, then was stolen from my hallway. I have reason to believe it was someone from my building, but I have waited three days.
        I am so mad! <br><br> It's not even something worth stealing! But they did and haven't returned it. 

        I don't even think I'll get my money back from Digi-Key.

        <br><br>
        This sets me back at least two weeks to account for delivery time.
